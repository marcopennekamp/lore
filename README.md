# Lore

**Lore** is a general-purpose programming language featuring multi-functions, a type-safe entity-component system, and intersection and semantic types.

To learn more about the language, read the [introduction](spec/01-introduction.md) to our spec.




#### State of the Project

**I am currently writing the language specification.** There is no Lore compiler, yet. We have a small experimental compiler that is used to test several multiple-dispatch concepts and implement core algorithms. 

We are planning to support Javascript as a target because of its ubiquity. Javascript has the advantage that it is easy to interface with and has an excellent VM/JIT implementation.

This is a hobby project I'm working on infrequently. I'd be happy just getting the language spec up to shape. It's a lot of fun to think everything through without any of the pressure that's usually associated with commercial or academic software projects.
