# Lore

Lore is a general-purpose programming language with support for traditional and composition-based inheritance. 


### Vision

We want to create a modern programming language for game programming with first-class support for entity-component systems. While Lore will be *inspired by* game development, it won't be *tailored to* game development. We want Lore to be a general-purpose programming language that will be usable in other areas as well. 


### State of the Project

We are currently writing the language specification. No working software has been written that would even closely resemble a Lore compiler.

We are planning to support the following targets:
* Javascript, because of its ubiquity
* Lua, because of its heavy use in game development
* SourceScript3, for shits and giggles

Both targets have the additional advantage that they are easy to interface with and each have an excellent VM/JIT implementation avaliable for comfortable performance.

Feel free to read and discuss the specification, which is currently located in the *articles* folder. We are open to all ideas.
