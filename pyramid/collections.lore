function append(list: [A], element: B): [A] where A, B <: A = dynamic[[A]]('Lore.values.list.append', list, element)

// TODO: If we change lists to our own custom implementation, it would still be useful to expose some kind of
//       interface for Javascript arrays, just in case they are needed by the developer. This would be the place
//       to do so. However, we would first need some way to define a class whose implementation is deferred to
//       Javascript, much like dynamic calls do for functions.
//       Arrays could be typed #[T] with a constructor #[t1, t2, t3].
