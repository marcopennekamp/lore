# Functional Reactive Programming

The FRP idea provides an interesting point of view on mutability through events that might be appropriate for game development. We'd like to delve into this concept and maybe promote it for use in Lore. While it is unlikely that FRP will be a first-class language feature, we should take special care with the language design to keep it FRP-friendly. If we want to support FRP, we should also ensure that FRP frameworks can be used with Lore and provide examples of using some frameworks. Finally, we should explore how FRP can be best used with the language features that Lore provides.
