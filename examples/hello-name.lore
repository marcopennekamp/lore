// TODO: Don't encourage doing this, probably. We'd have to handle narrowing list types to [Nothing] after elements
//       are removed if we want to support this particular feature. This is feasible, but not consistent with the
//       rest of the widen-only policy. Narrowing lists of arbitrary size is simply not fast enough and provides
//       little value. I feel like allowing then dispatch for this one special case [Nothing] would be a noob trap
//       as they'd extrapolate this limited feature to mean that this works for all element types in general.
