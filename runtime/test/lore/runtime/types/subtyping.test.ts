// TODO: Write subtyping tests.
// TODO: The problem is that we should test both the runtime and the compiler with the same types to ensure
//       feature parity. This is paramount since we have two parallel implementations. Instead of replicating
//       the tests, which is error-prone itself, we should try to define these tests in some known file format
//       and then interpret these "config" files in each of our test suites.
